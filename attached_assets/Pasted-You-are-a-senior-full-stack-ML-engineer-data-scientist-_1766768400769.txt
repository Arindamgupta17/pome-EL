You are a senior full-stack ML engineer, data scientist, and UI/UX designer.

I already have a TRAINED employee attrition prediction model saved as a .pkl file.
DO NOT retrain the model.
ONLY load and use the existing trained model.

Your task is to build a COMPLETE, END-TO-END, PROFESSIONAL web application
(frontend + backend) that correctly feeds inputs to the model and displays
predictions, explanations, and charts in a premium dashboard style.

================================================
BACKEND REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL)
================================================

- Use Python + Flask
- Load the trained model from a .pkl file using joblib or pickle
- Validate that the model loads correctly on startup
- Expose a POST endpoint `/predict`
- Accept JSON input from frontend
- Maintain EXACT FEATURE ORDER as used during training
- Return JSON containing:
  - attrition_prediction (0 or 1)
  - attrition_probability (percentage)
  - risk_level (Low / Medium / High)
  - feature_summary (human-readable explanation)
  - feature_contributions (approximate or mock SHAP-style values)

================================================
EXACT FEATURE ENCODINGS (DO NOT CHANGE)
================================================

1️⃣ JobRole (Label Encoded – alphabetical order):

0 = Business Analyst  
1 = Cloud Engineer  
2 = Data Analyst  
3 = Data Scientist  
4 = IT Support / System Administrator  
5 = Machine Learning Engineer  
6 = Product Manager  
7 = Senior Software Engineer  
8 = Software Engineer  

Frontend MUST show dropdown labels but send encoded integers.

---

2️⃣ Department (Label Encoded):

0 = Business Analysis  
1 = Cloud & Infrastructure  
2 = Customer Support  
3 = Data & AI  
4 = Engineering / Development  
5 = Human Resources  

---

3️⃣ WorkLifeBalance (Already Standard – Integer):

1 = Poor  
2 = Fair  
3 = Good  
4 = Excellent  

---

4️⃣ JobSatisfaction (Same Mapping as WorkLifeBalance):

1 = Poor  
2 = Fair  
3 = Good  
4 = Excellent  

---

5️⃣ StockOptionLevel:

0 = None  
1 = Low  
2 = Medium  
3 = High  

---

🎯 Target Variable:
- Attrition
  - 0 = Employee Stays
  - 1 = Employee Leaves

================================================
FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS (DESIGN + UX)
================================================

- Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript (NO React)
- Modern dashboard UI:
  - Glassmorphism
  - Smooth animations
  - Professional academic look
- Responsive layout
- Use Chart.js for charts

📌 Input Section:
- Dropdowns for JobRole & Department
- Sliders or radio buttons for WorkLifeBalance & JobSatisfaction
- Dropdown for StockOptionLevel
- Tooltips explaining each feature
- Reset button

📌 Results Section:
- Risk badge:
  - Green = Low
  - Yellow = Medium
  - Red = High
- Attrition probability (%)
- Animated progress bar or gauge
- Binary prediction text:
  - “Likely to Stay”
  - “High Risk of Attrition”

================================================
CHARTS & VISUALIZATIONS
================================================

Include Chart.js visuals:
1) Attrition Probability Bar / Gauge
2) Feature Contribution Bar Chart
3) Mock Historical Attrition Distribution Chart (for presentation)

================================================
INSIGHTS & EXPLANATIONS (VERY IMPORTANT)
================================================

Generate human-readable insights such as:
- “Low job satisfaction significantly increases attrition risk”
- “Lack of stock options contributes to disengagement”
- “Work-life balance is a stabilizing factor”

================================================
HR ACTION PLAN SECTION
================================================

Auto-generate recommendations based on risk level:

Low Risk:
- Maintain engagement
- Recognition programs

Medium Risk:
- Career discussion
- Compensation review

High Risk:
- Retention bonus
- Role redesign
- Work-life balance intervention

================================================
BONUS (FOR PROFESSORS & PAPER)
================================================

Add a “Research Mode” toggle that shows:
- Model type
- Input features
- Encoding strategy
- Ethical disclaimer:
  “This system is a decision-support tool, not a replacement for human judgment.”

Footer text:
“AI-Powered Employee Attrition Intelligence System”

================================================
FINAL OUTPUT
================================================

Deliver:
- Fully working Flask app
- Correct predictions using the trained model
- Accurate encoding & feature order
- Premium dashboard UI
- Charts, insights, and recommendations
- Ready for:
  - Professor demo
  - Research paper screenshots
  - GitHub publication

Start by building the backend first, then the frontend, then connect both.
